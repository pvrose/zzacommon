ZZACOMMON is a library of useful methods and classes developed for ZZALOG but
that have been generalised for use with other projects.

ZZACOMMON is based in part on the work of the FLTK project <A HREF=https://www.fltk.org>https://www.fltk.org</A>.

It provides a number of FLTK-derived widgets for general use:

\par banner
This is a banner window that provides a progress wheel and status message screen. 
See \ref banner.
\par button_input
This is a combination of Fl_Input and Fl_Button where clicking the button interacts
in some way with the operation of the input. This is only ever intended to be used
as the basis for other widgets: it is not a free-standing widget. 
See \ref button_input.
\par calendar_input
This is a version of button_input where the button opens a calendat window to allow
a date to be selected that is then placed as the text value of the input.
See \ref calendar_input.
\par calendar
The calendar window opened by the button in calendar_input.
See \ref calendar.
\par calendar_table
The calendar object used in calendar.
See \ref calendar_input.
\par callback.h
This is a set of standard callbacks that can be used either directly as the callback
for widget operations or used within custom callbacks.
See \ref callback.h.
\par drawing.h
This is a set of drawing constants to maintain a consistent "look-and-feel" across
all projects.
See \ref drawing.h.
\par filename_input
This is a version of button_input where the button opens a file browser and the selected
filename is then copied to the text value of the input widget.
See \ref filename_input.
\par file_holder
This class provides a consistent approach to filestore management used across all
projects.
See \ref file_holder.
\par input_hierch
This is an extension of Fl_Input_Choice that uses a hierarchic menu for use where
there are a large number of menu options. The supplied options are split into
groups according to the first letter (or more) of the option.
See \ref input_hierch.
\par password_input
This is a version of button_input where the button toggles the behaviour of the input between
FL_NORMAL_INPUT (where the text is visible) and FL_SECRET_INPUT (where the text
is masked).
See \ref password_input.
\par settings
This class provides a JSON based settings file.
See \ref settings.
\par status
This class encapsulates banner and is the main user interface for it.
See \ref status.
\par symbols
This is a set of methods that each draw an image to be used in widget labels using the
'\@' construct.
See \ref symbols.h.
\par tabs_nonav
This is an extension of Fl_Tabs that inhibits the use of navigaton keys to switch
between tab entries.
See \ref tabs_nonav.
\par ticker
This class provides an application-wide clock that can send timer callbacks to 
subscribed instances within the application. It, itself, receives a callback
every 100 ms and forwards it to subscribers according to their needs.
See \ref ticker.
\par utils
This is a set of standard utility methods.
See \ref utils.h.
